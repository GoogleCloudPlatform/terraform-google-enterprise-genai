# Multimodal RAG Langchain Example

## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular paradigm for enabling LLMs to access external data and also as a mechanism for [Grounding](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview), to mitigate against hallucinations.

In this notebook, you will perform multimodal RAG by performing Q&A over a financial document filled with both text and images.

This example is an adapted version of the sample Generative AI notebook from the Google Cloud codebase. You can find the original example and other notebooks in the [Google Cloud Platform Generative AI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main) repository.

The main modifications to the original example include:

- Adaptations to comply with Cloud Foundation Toolkit security measures.
- Installation of additional libraries in the Conda environment.
- Use of Vertex AI Workbench to run the notebook with a custom Service Account in a secure environment.
- Implementation of Vector Search on Vertex AI with [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect).

For more information about the technologies used in this example, please refer to the following resources:

- [Vertex AI Workbench Introduction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction)
- [Vertex AI Vector Search Overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview)
- [Ragas Documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/)

After ensuring all requirements are satisfied you can follow one of the two deployment options:

1. [**Using Machine Learning Infra Pipeline**](#deploying-infrastructure-using-machine-learning-infra-pipeline): This is a robust option suitable for production environments and continuous deployment scenarios.
2. [**Using Terraform Locally**](#deploying-infrastructure-using-terraform-locally): This is a better option for one-time testing purposes where you know you will delete the example later.

## Requirements

- Terraform v1.7.5
- [Authenticated Google Cloud SDK 469.0.0](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing)

### Terraform Variables Configuration

- Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with values from your environment.

  ```terraform
  kms_key                   = "projects/KMS-PROJECT-ID/locations/REGION/keyRings/ML-ENV-KEYRING/cryptoKeys/ML-ENV-KEY"
  network                   = "projects/NETWORK-PROJECT-ID/global/networks/NETWORK-NAME"
  subnet                    = "projects/NETWORK-PROJECT-ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET-NAME"
  machine_learning_project  = "MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-ID"
  vector_search_vpc_project = "NETWORK-PROJECT-ID"
  ```

- Assuming you are deploying the example on top of the development environment, the following instructions will provide you more insight on how to retrieve these values:
  - **NETWORK-PROJECT-ID**: Run `terraform -chdir="envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id` on `gcp-networks` repository at the development branch. Please note that if you have not initialized the environment you will need to run `./tf-wrapper.sh init development` on the directory.
  - **NETWORK-NAME**: Run `terraform -chdir="envs/development" output -raw restricted_network_name` on `gcp-networks` repository at the development branch. Please note that if you have not initialized the environment you will need to run `./tf-wrapper.sh init development` on the directory.
  - **MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-ID**: Run `terraform -chdir="ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id` on `gcp-projects` repository, at the development branch. Please note that if you have not initialized the environment you will need to run `./tf-wrapper.sh init development` on the directory.
  - **KMS-PROJECT-ID**, **ML-ENV-KEYRING**, **ML-ENV-KEY**: Run `terraform -chdir="ml_business_unit/development" output machine_learning_kms_keys` on `gcp-projects` repository, at the development branch. Please note that if you have not initialized the environment you will need to run `./tf-wrapper.sh init development` on the directory.
  - **REGION**: The chosen region.

  - Optionally, you may follow the series of steps below to automatically cre the `terraform.tfvars` file:
    - **IMPORTANT:** Please note that the steps below are assuming you are checked out on the same level as `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/` and the other repos (`gcp-bootstrap`, `gcp-org`, `gcp-projects`...).
    - Retrieve values from terraform outputs to bash variables:

      ```bash
      (cd gcp-networks && git checkout development && ./tf-wrapper.sh init development)

      export restricted_host_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-networks/envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)

      export restricted_network_name=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-networks/envs/development" output -raw restricted_network_name)

      (cd gcp-projects && git checkout development && ./tf-wrapper.sh init development)

      export machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)

      export machine_learning_kms_keys_json=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)
      ```

    - Extract the kms key from the `json` variable by using `jq`:

      ```bash
      export machine_learning_kms_keys=$(echo $machine_learning_kms_keys_json | jq -r ".\"$region\".id")
      ```

    - Create region environment variable (if you are not using `us-central1`, remember to change the value below):

      ```bash
      export region="us-central1"
      ```

    - Validate if the variables values are correct:

      ```bash
      echo region=$region
      echo restricted_host_project_id=$restricted_host_project_id
      echo restricted_network_name=$restricted_network_name
      echo machine_learning_project_id=$machine_learning_project_id
      echo machine_learning_kms_keys=$machine_learning_kms_keys
      ```

    - Populate `terraform.tfvars` with the following command:

      ```bash
      cat > terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal/terraform.tfvars <<EOF
      kms_key                   = "$machine_learning_kms_keys"
      network                   = "projects/$restricted_host_project_id/global/networks/$restricted_network_name"
      subnet                    = "projects/$restricted_host_project_id/regions/$region/subnetworks/sb-d-shared-restricted-$region"
      machine_learning_project  = "$machine_learning_project_id"
      vector_search_vpc_project = "$restricted_host_project_id"
      EOF
      ```

    - Validate if all values are correct in `terraform.tfvars`

      ```bash
      cat terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal/terraform.tfvars
      ```

## Deploying infrastructure using Machine Learning Infra Pipeline

### Required Permissions and VPC-SC adjustments for pipeline Service Account

- The Service Account that runs the Pipeline must have `roles/compute.networkUser` on the Shared VPC Host Project, you can give this role by running the command below:

  ```bash
  (cd gcp-projects && git checkout production && ./tf-wrapper.sh init shared)
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="./gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq -r '."ml-machine-learning"')

  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding  $restricted_host_project_id --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT" --role="roles/compute.networkUser"
  ```

- Add the build service account in the development VPC-SC perimeter.
  - Retrieve the service account value for your environment:

    ```bash
    echo "serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
    ```
  
  - Add "serviceAccount:<YOUR_SA_HERE>" to `perimeter_additional_members` field in `common.auto.tfvars` at `gcp-networks` repository on the development branch.

  - Commit and push the result by running the commands below:

    ```bash
    cd gcp-networks
    git add common.auto.tfvars
    git commit -m "Add machine learning build SA to perimeter"
    git push origin development
    ```

### Deployment steps

**IMPORTANT:** Please note that the steps below are assuming you are checked out on the same level as `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/` and the other repos (`gcp-bootstrap`, `gcp-org`, `gcp-projects`...).

- Retrieve the Project ID where the Machine Learning Pipeline Repository is located in.

  ```bash
  export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
  echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
  ```

- Clone the repository.

  ```bash
  gcloud source repos clone ml-machine-learning --project=${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
  ```

- Navigate into the repo and the desired branch. Create directories if they don't exist.

  ```bash
  cd ml-machine-learning
  git checkout -b development

  mkdir -p ml_business_unit/development
  mkdir -p modules
  ```

- Copy required files to the repository.

  ```bash
  cp -R ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal ./modules
  cp ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
  cp ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
  chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh

  cat ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal/terraform.tfvars >> ml_business_unit/development/genai_example.auto.tfvars
  cat ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal/variables.tf >> ml_business_unit/development/variables.tf
  ```

  > NOTE: Make sure there are no variable name collision for variables under `terraform-google-enterprise-genaiexamples/genai-rag-multimodal/variables.tf` and that your `terraform.tfvars` is updated with values from your environment.

- Validate that variables under `ml_business_unit/development/genai_example.auto.tfvars` are correct.

  ```bash
  cat ml_business_unit/development/genai_example.auto.tfvars
  ```

- Create a file named `genai_example.tf` under `ml_business_unit/development` path that calls the module.

  ```bash
  cat > ml_business_unit/development/genai_example.tf <<EOF
  module "genai_example" {
    source = "../../modules/genai-rag-multimodal"

    kms_key                   = var.kms_key
    network                   = var.network
    subnet                    = var.subnet
    machine_learning_project  = var.machine_learning_project
    vector_search_vpc_project = var.vector_search_vpc_project
  }
  EOF
  ```

- Verify if `backend.tf` file exists at `ml-machine-learning/ml_business_unit/development`.
  - If there is a `backend.tf` file, proceed with the next step (commit and push) and ignore the sub-steps below.
  - If there is no `backend.tf` file, follow the sub-steps below:
    - Create the file by running the command below:

      ```bash
      cat > ml_business_unit/development/backend.tf <<EOF
      terraform {
        backend "gcs" {
          bucket = "UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET"
          prefix = "terraform/app-infra/ml_business_unit/development"
        }
      }
      EOF
      ```

    - Run the command below to update `UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET` placeholder:

      ```bash
      export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -json state_buckets | jq '."ml-machine-learning"' --raw-output)
      echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

      for i in `find -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
      ```

- Commit and push

  ```terraform
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add GenAI example"

  git push origin development
  ```

## Deploying infrastructure using terraform locally

- Only proceed with these steps if you have not deployed [using cloudbuild](#deploying-infrastructure-using-machine-learning-infra-pipeline).
- Run `terraform init` inside this directory.
- Run `terraform apply` inside this directory.

## Post-Deployment

### Allow file download from Google Notebook Examples Bucket on VPC-SC Perimeter

When running the Notebook, you will reach a step that downloads an example PDF file from a bucket, you need to add the egress rule below on the VPC-SC perimeter to allow the operation. You can do this by adding this rule to `egress_rule` variable on `gcp-networks/envs/development/development.auto.tfvars` on the development branch.

> NOTE: If you are deploying this example on top of an existing foundation instance, the variable name might be `egress_policies`.

```terraform
{
  "from" = {
    "identity_type" = ""
    "identities" = [
      "serviceAccount:rag-notebook-runner@<INSERT_YOUR_MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID_HERE>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ]
  },
  "to" = {
    "resources" = ["projects/200612033880"]  # Google Cloud Example Project
    "operations" = {
        "storage.googleapis.com" = {
        "methods" = [
            "google.storage.buckets.list",
            "google.storage.buckets.get",
            "google.storage.objects.get",
            "google.storage.objects.list",
          ]
        }
    }
  }
},
```

> **IMPORTANT**: If you are planning to delete the notebook-runner service account at any moment, make sure you remove this policy before deleting it.

## Usage

Once all the requirements are set up, you can start by running and adjusting the notebook step-by-step.

To run the notebook, open the Google Cloud Console on Vertex AI Workbench (`https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances?referrer=search&project=<MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID>`), click open JupyterLab on the created instance.

After clicking "open JupyterLab" button, you will be taken to an interactive JupyterLab Workspace, you can upload the notebook (`multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb`) in this repo to it. Once the notebook is uploaded to the environment, run it cell-by-cell to see process of building a RAG chain. The notebook contains placeholders variables that must be replaced, you may follow the next section instructions to automatically replace this placeholders using `sed` command.

### Optional: Use `terraform output` and bash command to fill in fields in the notebook

#### Infra Pipeline (Cloud Build)

If you ran using Cloud Build, proceed with the steps below to use `terraform output`.

- Update `outputs.tf` file on `ml-machine-learning/ml_business_unit/development` and add the following values to it, if the file does not exist create it:

  ```terraform
  output "private_endpoint_ip_address" {
    value       = module.genai_example.private_endpoint_ip_address
  }

  output "host_vpc_project_id" {
    value       = module.genai_example.host_vpc_project_id
  }

  output "host_vpc_network" {
    value       = module.genai_example.host_vpc_network
  }

  output "notebook_project_id" {
    value       = module.genai_example.notebook_project_id
  }

  output "vector_search_bucket_name" {
    value       = module.genai_example.vector_search_bucket_name
  }
  ```

- Run `./tf-wrapper.sh init development` on `ml-machine-learning`.

- Run `cd ml_business_unit/development && terraform refresh`, to refresh the outputs.

- Extract values from `terraform output` and validate. You must run the commands below at `ml-machine-learning/ml_business_unit/development`.

  ```bash
  export private_endpoint_ip_address=$(terraform output -raw private_endpoint_ip_address)
  echo private_endpoint_ip_address=$private_endpoint_ip_address

  export host_vpc_project_id=$(terraform output -raw host_vpc_project_id)
  echo host_vpc_project_id=$host_vpc_project_id

  export notebook_project_id=$(terraform output -raw notebook_project_id)
  echo notebook_project_id=$notebook_project_id

  export vector_search_bucket_name=$(terraform output -raw vector_search_bucket_name)
  echo vector_search_bucket_name=$vector_search_bucket_name

  export host_vpc_network=$(terraform output -raw host_vpc_network)
  echo host_vpc_network=$host_vpc_network
  ```

- Search and Replace using `sed` command at `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal`.

  ```bash
  cd ../../../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/genai-rag-multimodal

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_PRIVATE_IP_VALUE_HERE>/$private_endpoint_ip_address/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_HOST_VPC_PROJECT_ID>/$host_vpc_project_id/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_NOTEBOOK_PROJECT_ID>/$notebook_project_id/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_BUCKET_NAME>/$vector_search_bucket_name/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s:<INSERT_HOST_VPC_NETWORK>:$host_vpc_network:g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb
  ```

#### Terraform Locally

If you ran terraform locally, proceed with the steps below to use `terraform output`.

You can save some time adjusting the notebook by running the commands below:

- Extract values from `terraform output` and validate.

  ```bash
  export private_endpoint_ip_address=$(terraform output -raw private_endpoint_ip_address)
  echo private_endpoint_ip_address=$private_endpoint_ip_address

  export host_vpc_project_id=$(terraform output -raw host_vpc_project_id)
  echo host_vpc_project_id=$host_vpc_project_id

  export notebook_project_id=$(terraform output -raw notebook_project_id)
  echo notebook_project_id=$notebook_project_id

  export vector_search_bucket_name=$(terraform output -raw vector_search_bucket_name)
  echo vector_search_bucket_name=$vector_search_bucket_name

  export host_vpc_network=$(terraform output -raw host_vpc_network)
  echo host_vpc_network=$host_vpc_network
  ```

- Search and Replace using `sed` command.

  ```bash
  sed -i "s/<INSERT_PRIVATE_IP_VALUE_HERE>/$private_endpoint_ip_address/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_HOST_VPC_PROJECT_ID>/$host_vpc_project_id/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_NOTEBOOK_PROJECT_ID>/$notebook_project_id/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s/<INSERT_BUCKET_NAME>/$vector_search_bucket_name/g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb

  sed -i "s:<INSERT_HOST_VPC_NETWORK>:$host_vpc_network:g" multimodal_rag_langchain.ipynb
  ```

## Notes

- Some, but not exclusively, of the billable components deployed are: Vertex AI Workbench Instance, Private Service Connect Endpoint and Vector Search Endpoint.

## Known Issues

- `Error: Error creating Instance: googleapi: Error 400: value_to_check(https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...) is not found`.
  - When creating the VertexAI Workbench Instance through terraform you might face this issue. The issue is being tracked on this [link](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/17904).
  - If you face this issue you will not be able to use terraform to create the instance, therefore, you will need to manually create it on [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) using the same parameters.
