# Machine Learning Pipeline Overview

This example demonstrates the process of interactive coding and experimentation using the Google Vertex AI Workbench for data scientists. The guide outlines the creation of a machine learning (ML) pipeline within a notebook on a Google Vertex AI Workbench Instance.

This environment is set up for interactive coding and experimentations. After the project is up, the vertex workbench will be deployed from the base environment module on `/modules/base_env/main.tf` and the data scientists can use it to write their data processing code and pipeline components. In addition, a cloud storage bucket should be deployed to use as the storage for our operations. Optionally, a composer environment can be setup to schedule the pipeline run on intervals.

Each environment, Development, Non-Production and Production have their own purpose and they are not a mirror from the previous environment.

The Development environment is responsible to create pipeline components and make sure there are no issues in the environment.

The non-production environment will result in triggering the pipeline if approved. The vertex pipeline takes about 30 minutes to finish.

The production environment will provide an endpoint in the project which you can use to make prediction requests.

## Steps Involved

- Creating the ML Pipeline:
  - Use a notebook on Google Vertex AI Workbench Instance to develop and adjust the ML pipeline on the development environment.
- Triggering the Pipeline:
  - The pipeline is set to trigger via Cloud Build upon merges to the non-production branch after being validated on development environment.
- Training and Deploying the Model:
  - The model is trained and deployed using the census income dataset.
  - Deployment and monitoring occur in the production environment.
- A/B Testing:
  - After successful pipeline runs, a new model version is deployed for A/B testing.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.
1. 2-environments executed successfully.
1. 3-networks executed successfully.
1. 4-projects executed successfully.
1. 5-app-infra executed successfully.
1. The step below named `VPC-SC` executed successfully, configuring the VPC-SC rules that allows running the example.

**IMPORTANT**: The steps below are specific if you are deploying via `Cloud Build`. If you are deploying using Local Terraform, skip directly to the `VPC-SC - Infrastructure Deployment with Local Terraform` section.

### VPC-SC - Infrastructure Deployment with Cloud Build

By now, `artifact-publish` and `service-catalog` have been deployed. The projects inflated under `machine-learning-pipeline` are set in a service perimiter for added security.  As such, several services and accounts must be given ingress and egress policies before the notebook and the pipeline has been deployed. Below, you can find the values that will need to be applied to `common.auto.tfvars` and your `development.auto.tfvars`, `non-production.auto.tfvars` & `production.auto.tfvars`, each respective to it's own environment.

To create new ingress/egress rules on the VPC-SC perimiter, follow the steps below:

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that command below are running `terraform output` command, this means that the directories must be initialized with `terraform -chdir="<insert_desired_env_here>" init` if it was not already initialized.

#### `development` environment

## Usage with Cloud Build

These environmental project inflations are closely tied to the `service-catalog` project that have already deployed.  By now, the `ml-service-catalog` should have been inflated.  `service-catalog` contains modules that are being deployed in an interactive (development) environment. Since they already exist; they can be used as terraform modules for operational (non-production, production) environments.  This was done in order to avoid code redundancy. One area for all `machine-learning` deployments.

Under `modules/base_env/main.tf` you will notice all module calls are using `git` links as sources.  These links refer to the `service-catalog` cloud source repository we have already set up.

### Infrastructure Deployment with Cloud Build

Github App ID allows you to connect your GitHub repository to Cloud Build and it is optional to use or not.

In case you want to integrate Github with Cloud Build you must have a github token for access to your repository ready, along with an [Application Installation Id](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/github/connect-repo-github#connecting_a_github_host_programmatically) and the remote uri to your repository.

The `GITHUB_APP_ID` value can be retrieved after [installing Cloud Build GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/google-cloud-build) on your GitHub account or in an organization you own.

The id can be retrieved when accessing the app configuration page by retrieving its value on the URL (https://github.com/settings/installations/<APPLICATION_ID_HERE>). To access the app configuration page, go to **Settings -> Applications -> Google Cloud Build (Configure Button)** on your github account.

The `GITHUB_REMOTE_URI` value can be retrieved by creating a new github repository and copying its value.

1. Clone the `ml-machine-learning` repo.

   ```bash
   export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}

   gcloud source repos clone ml-machine-learning --project=${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Navigate into the repo, change to non-main branch and copy contents of foundation to new repo.
   All subsequent steps assume you are running them from the ml-machine-learning directory.
   If you run them from another directory, adjust your copy paths accordingly.

   ```bash
   cd ml-machine-learning
   git checkout -b plan

   cp -RT ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline .
   cp ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` to `common.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. If you are not integrating Github with Cloud Build, you can skip this step, otherwise you need to update the `common.auto.tfvars` file with your github app installation id, along with the url of your repository. Remember to uncomment the lines below that refer to Github.

   ```bash
   GITHUB_APP_ID="YOUR-GITHUB-APP-ID-HERE"
   GITHUB_REMOTE_URI="YOUR-GITHUB-REMOTE-URI"

   sed -i "s/GITHUB_APP_ID/${GITHUB_APP_ID}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   sed -i "s/GITHUB_REMOTE_URI/${GITHUB_REMOTE_URI}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Use `terraform output` to get the project backend bucket value from 0-bootstrap.

   ```bash
   export remote_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/envs/shared" output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${remote_state_bucket}"
   sed -i "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${remote_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Use `terraform output` to retrieve the Service Catalog project-id from the projects step and update values in `module/base_env`.

   ```bash
   export service_catalog_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw service_catalog_project_id)
   echo "service_catalog_project_id = ${service_catalog_project_id}"

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/SERVICE_CATALOG_PROJECT_ID/${service_catalog_project_id}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Update bucket variable, to retrieve values from 2-environment steps.

    ```bash
    export seed_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/envs/shared" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
    echo "seed_state_bucket = ${seed_state_bucket}"

    sed -i "s/REPLACE_SEED_TFSTATE_BUCKET/${seed_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
    ```

1. Update `vpc_project` variable with the development environment host VPC project.

   ```bash
   export vpc_project=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-networks/envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
   echo $vpc_project

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/REPLACE_WITH_DEV_VPC_PROJECT/${vpc_project}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Update `intance_owners` variable with you GCP user account email. Replace `INSERT_YOUR_USER_EMAIL_HERE` with your email.

   ```bash
   export user_email="INSERT_YOUR_USER_EMAIL_HERE"

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/REPLACE_WITH_USER_GCP_EMAIL/${user_email}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Update `backend.tf` with your bucket from the infra pipeline output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -json state_buckets | jq '."ml-machine-learning"' --raw-output)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   ## Linux
   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   ```

1. Allow the Cloud Build Service Account to read 2-environments state.

1. Retrieve the value for "sa-tf-cb-ml-machine-learning@[prj_c_ml_infra_pipeline_project_id].iam.gserviceaccount.com" on your environment by running:

    ```bash
    export ml_cb_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq -r '."ml-machine-learning"')
    echo $ml_cb_sa
    ```

1. Assign Storage Object Viewer on bucket:

    ```bash
    gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$seed_state_bucket \
            --member=serviceAccount:$ml_cb_sa \
            --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
    ```

1. Assign Artifact Registry Admin on publish artifacts project:

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $common_artifacts_project_id \
            --member=serviceAccount:$ml_cb_sa \
            --role=roles/artifactregistry.admin
    ```

1. Commit changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize repo'
   ```

1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan for all environments. Because the
   *plan* branch is not a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch), pushing your *plan*
   branch triggers *terraform plan* but not *terraform apply*. Review the plan output in your Cloud Build project <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID>

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. Merge changes to development. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both *terraform plan* and *terraform apply*. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID>

   ```
   git checkout -b development
   git push origin development
   ```

   **Note:** In case of message of error `Error: Provider produced inconsistent final plan` in the Cloud Build, a Retry should be done.

1. Merge changes to non-production. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both *terraform plan* and *terraform apply*. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID>

   ```bash
   git checkout -b non-production
   git push origin non-production
   ```

1. Merge changes to production branch. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
      pushing to this branch triggers both *terraform plan* and *terraform apply*. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID>

   ```bash
   git checkout -b production
   git push origin production
   ```

1. cd out of this directory

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

### VPC-SC - Infrastructure Deployment with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build

By now, `artifact-publish` and `service-catalog` have been deployed. The projects inflated under `machine-learning-pipeline` are set in a service perimiter for added security.  As such, several services and accounts must be given ingress and egress policies before the notebook and the pipeline has been deployed. Below, you can find the values that will need to be applied to `common.auto.tfvars` and your `development.auto.tfvars`, `non-production.auto.tfvars` & `production.auto.tfvars`, each respective to it's own environment.

To create new ingress/egress rules on the VPC-SC perimiter, follow the steps below:

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that command below are running `terraform output` command, this means that the directories must be initialized with `terraform -chdir="<insert_desired_env_here>" init` if it was not already initialized.

    cat <<EOF
    ------------------------
    Add the following service accounts to perimeter_additional_members on common.auto.tfvars.
    ------------------------
    "serviceAccount:$ml_cb_sa",
    "serviceAccount:$env_step_sa",
    "serviceAccount:service-${prj_p_logging_project_number}@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:${prj_p_machine_learning_project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:project-service-account@${prj_p_machine_learning_project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:${prj_n_machine_learning_project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
    EOF
    ```

##### Ingress Policies and Egress Policies

1. You can find the `sources.access_level` information by going to `Security` in your GCP Organization.
Once there, select the perimeter that is associated with the environment (eg. `production`). Copy the string under Perimeter Name and place it under `YOUR_ACCESS_LEVEL` or by running the following `gcloud` command:

    ```bash
    export org_id=$(terraform -chdir="../1-org/envs/shared" output  -raw org_id)
    echo $org_id

    export policy_id=$(gcloud access-context-manager policies list --organization $org_id --format="value(name)")
    echo $policy_id

    export access_level=$(gcloud access-context-manager perimeters list --policy=$policy_id --filter=status.resources:projects/$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number --format="value(status.accessLevels)")
    echo $access_level
    ```

1. Retrieve `env_kms_project_number` variable value:

    ```bash
    export env_kms_project_number=$(terraform -chdir="../2-environments/envs/production" output -raw env_kms_project_number)
    echo $env_kms_project_number
    ```

1. Retrieve `restricted_host_project_number` variable value:

    ```bash
    terraform -chdir="envs/production" init

    export restricted_host_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="envs/production" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
    echo $restricted_host_project_id

    export restricted_host_project_number=$(gcloud projects list --filter="projectId=$restricted_host_project_id" --format="value(projectNumber)")
    echo $restricted_host_project_number
    ```

1. Retrieve the value of `common_artifacts_project_id` (note that this is a value from `shared` environment, this means that gcp-projects must be initialized on production branch):

    ```bash
    export directory="../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared"

    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="$directory" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    export common_artifacts_project_number=$(gcloud projects list --filter="projectId=$common_artifacts_project_id" --format="value(projectNumber)")
    echo $common_artifacts_project_number
    ```

1. Retrieve the value for `prj_p_machine_learning_project_number`:

    ```bash
    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_number
    ```

1. Run the following command to update the `3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/production/production.auto.tfvars` file. The output of this command will contain both ingress and egress policies variables values already replaced with the template located at `assets/vpc-sc-policies/production.tf.example`.

    ```bash
    sed -e "s:REPLACE_WITH_ACCESS_LEVEL:$access_level:g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_SHARED_RESTRICTED_VPC_PROJECT_NUMBER/$restricted_host_project_number/g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_ENV_KMS_PROJECT_NUMBER/$env_kms_project_number/g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_ENV_ML_PROJECT_NUMBER/$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number/g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_ARTIFACTS_PROJECT_NUMBER/$common_artifacts_project_number/g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_NON_PROD_PROJECT_NUMBER/$prj_n_machine_learning_project_number/g" \
      -e "s/REPLACE_WITH_LOGGING_PROJECT_NUMBER/$prj_p_logging_project_number/g" \
    ../examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/vpc-sc-policies/production.tf.example > envs/production/production.auto.tfvars
    ```

> *IMPORTANT*: The command above assumes you are running it on the  `3-networks-dual-svpc` directory.

1. Apply the results for development environment on `3-networks-dual-svpc`.

    ```bash
    ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
    ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production

    cd ../..
    ```

> **DISCLAIMER**: Remember that before deleting or destroying the `machine-learning-pipeline` example, you must remove the egress/ingress policies related to the example, to prevent any inconsistencies.

## Usage with Local Terraform

These environmental project inflations are closely tied to the `service-catalog` project that have already deployed.  By now, the `ml-service-catalog` should have been inflated.  `service-catalog` contains modules that are being deployed in an interactive (development) environment. Since they already exist; they can be used as terraform modules for operational (non-production, production) environments.  This was done in order to avoid code redundancy. One area for all `machine-learning` deployments.

Under `modules/base_env/main.tf` you will notice all module calls are using `git` links as sources.  These links refer to the `service-catalog` cloud source repository we have already set up.

### Infrastructure Deployment with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build

1. The next instructions assume that you are at the same level of the `terraform-google-enterprise-genai` folder. Change into `machine-learning-pipeline` example folder, copy the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed.

   ```bash
   cd terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline
   cp ../../build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` files to `common.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. If you are not integrating Github with Cloud Build, you can skip this step, otherwise you need to update the common.auto.tfvars file with your github app installation id, along with the url of your repository. Remember to uncomment the lines below that refer to Github.

   ```bash
    GITHUB_APP_ID="YOUR-GITHUB-APP-ID-HERE"
    GITHUB_REMOTE_URI="YOUR-GITHUB-REMOTE-URI"

    sed -i "s/GITHUB_APP_ID/${GITHUB_APP_ID}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
    sed -i "s/GITHUB_REMOTE_URI/${GITHUB_REMOTE_URI}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Update `common.auto.tfvars` file with values from your environment. Use `terraform output` to get the project and seed backend bucket value from 0-bootstrap.

   ```bash
   export remote_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../../0-bootstrap/" output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${remote_state_bucket}"
   sed -i "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${remote_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars

   export seed_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../../0-bootstrap/" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "seed_state_bucket = ${seed_state_bucket}"
   sed -i "s/REPLACE_SEED_TFSTATE_BUCKET/${seed_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Provide the user that will be running `./tf-wrapper.sh` the Service Account Token Creator role to the ml Terraform service account.

1. Provide the user permissions to run the terraform locally with the `serviceAccountTokenCreator` permission.

   ```bash
   member="user:$(gcloud auth list --filter="status=ACTIVE" --format="value(account)")"
   echo ${member}

   project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${project_id}

   terraform_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq '."ml-machine-learning"' --raw-output)
   echo ${terraform_sa}

   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${terraform_sa} --project ${project_id} --member="${member}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
   ```

1. Update `backend.tf` with your bucket from the infra pipeline output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -json state_buckets | jq '."ml-machine-learning"' --raw-output)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   for i in `find -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   ```

1. Update `modules/base_env/main.tf` with Service Catalog Project Id.

   ```bash
   export service_catalog_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw service_catalog_project_id)
   echo "service_catalog_project_id = ${service_catalog_project_id}"

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/SERVICE_CATALOG_PROJECT_ID/${service_catalog_project_id}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Update `vpc_project` variable with the development environment host VPC project.

   ```bash
   export vpc_project=$(terraform -chdir="../../3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
   echo $vpc_project

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/REPLACE_WITH_DEV_VPC_PROJECT/${vpc_project}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Update `intance_owners` variable with you GCP user account email. Replace `INSERT_YOUR_USER_EMAIL_HERE` with your email.

   ```bash
   export user_email="INSERT_YOUR_USER_EMAIL_HERE"

   ## Linux
   sed -i "s/REPLACE_WITH_USER_GCP_EMAIL/${user_email}/g" ./modules/base_env/main.tf
   ```

1. Enable the Artifact Registry API for the `cloudbuild project`.

    ```bash
    export cloudbuild_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
    echo $cloudbuild_project_id

    gcloud services enable accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com --project=$cloudbuild_project_id
    ```

1. Retrieve the value for "sa-tf-cb-ml-machine-learning@[prj_c_ml_infra_pipeline_project_id].iam.gserviceaccount.com" on your environment by running:

    ```bash
    export ml_cb_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq -r '."ml-machine-learning"')
    echo $ml_cb_sa
    ```

1. Assign Storage Object Viewer on bucket:

    ```bash
    gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$seed_state_bucket \
            --member=serviceAccount:$ml_cb_sa \
            --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
    ```

1. Assign Artifact Registry Admin on publish artifacts project:

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $common_artifacts_project_id \
            --member=serviceAccount:$ml_cb_sa \
            --role=roles/artifactregistry.admin
    ```

We will now deploy each of our environments (development/production/non-production) using this script.
When using Cloud Build or Jenkins as your CI/CD tool, each environment corresponds to a branch in the repository for the `machine-learning-pipeline` step. Only the corresponding environment is applied.

To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Infra Pipeline Project ID from 4-projects output.

   ```bash
   export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared/" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq '."ml-machine-learning"' --raw-output)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```
- If you are using Github and you face some error related to Source Repo authentication, you need to access your Service Catalog repository `prj-c-mlservice-catalog-ID` `https://source.cloud.google.com/<service_catalog_project_id>/service-catalog` hit the `Clone` button in the right side -> how to setup -> Manually generated credentials and then follow the instructions in the step one `Generate and store your Git credentials`. Then, re-run the previous step again.

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate production $(pwd)/../../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment non-production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init non-production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan non-production
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate non-production $(pwd)/../../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` non-production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply non-production
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment development.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate development $(pwd)/../../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` development.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
   ```

If you received any errors or made any changes to the Terraform config or `common.auto.tfvars` you must re-run `./tf-wrapper.sh plan <env>` before running `./tf-wrapper.sh apply <env>`.

After executing this stage, unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

  ```bash
  unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  ```

## Post Infrastructure Deployment

### VPC-SC with Cloud Build

For the next step, we need to update the non-production and production VPC-SC perimeters by adding the service accounts listed below.

**IMPORTANT:** The content of `perimeter_additional_members` in the last line needs to follow this format: `"serviceAccount:YOUR-SERVICE_ACCOUNT"]`.

1. Obtain the service accounts to be used:

    ```bash
    cd gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production
    git checkout non-production

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    cd ../production
    git checkout production

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id

    export TRIGGER_SA="serviceAccount:trigger-sa@$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    export GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM="serviceAccount:service-$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    export API_ROBOT_SA="serviceAccount:cloud-aiplatform-api-robot-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com"

    echo $TRIGGER_SA
    echo $GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM
    echo $API_ROBOT_SA
    ```

**IMPORTANT:** The commands below assumes you are running it on the `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline` directory.

1. Run the command below to update the `perimeter_additional_members` in `common.auto.tfvars` for the non-production environment. The last line from your `perimeter_additional_members` should end following this format: `"serviceAccount:YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT"]` (with no comma in the and the `]` in the same line from the service account).

    ```bash

    cd ../../../gcp-networks/envs/non-production/
    git checkout non-production

    UPDATE_SA=$(printf '"%s",\n"%s",\n"%s"]' "$TRIGGER_SA" "$GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM" "$API_ROBOT_SA")

    TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)

    awk -v new_entries="$UPDATE_SA" '
      /perimeter_additional_members = \[/ {
        print
        in_list=1
        next
      }
      in_list && /\]$/ {
        sub(/\]$/, "")
        print $0 ","
        printf "%s\n", new_entries
        in_list=0
        next
      }
      {print}
    ' common.auto.tfvars > "$TEMP_FILE"

    mv "$TEMP_FILE" common.auto.tfvars

    cat common.auto.tfvars ; echo ""
    ```

1. Commit the results on gcp-networks.

    ```bash
    git add .

    git commit -m 'Update perimeter additional members'
    git push origin non-production
    ```

1. Run the command below to update the `perimeter_additional_members` in `common.auto.tfvars` for the production environment. The last line from your `perimeter_additional_members` should end following this format: `"serviceAccount:YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT"]` (with no comma in the and the `]` in the same line from the service account).

    ```bash

    cd ../production/
    git checkout production

    var_global=$(printf '"%s"]' "$GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM")

    TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)

    awk -v new_entry="$var_global" '
      /perimeter_additional_members = \[/ {
        print
        in_list=1
        next
      }
      in_list && /\]$/ {
        sub(/\]$/, "")
        print $0 ","
        printf "%s\n", new_entry
        in_list=0
        next
      }
      {print}
    ' common.auto.tfvars > "$TEMP_FILE"

    mv "$TEMP_FILE" common.auto.tfvars

    cat common.auto.tfvars ; echo ""
    ```

1. Commit the results on gcp-networks.

    ```bash
    git add .

    git commit -m 'Update perimeter additional members'
    git push origin production
    ```

### VPS-SC with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build

For the next step, we need to update the non-production and production VPC-SC perimeters by adding the service accounts listed below.

**IMPORTANT:** The content of perimeter_additional_members in the last line needs to follow this format: `"serviceAccount:YOUR-SERVICE_ACCOUNT"]`.

1. Obtain the service accounts to be used:

    ```bash
    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id

    export TRIGGER_SA="serviceAccount:trigger-sa@$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    export GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM="serviceAccount:service-$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    export API_ROBOT_SA="serviceAccount:cloud-aiplatform-api-robot-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com"

    echo $TRIGGER_SA
    echo $GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM
    echo $API_ROBOT_SA
    ```

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Seed project ID and the organization step Terraform service account from 0-bootstrap output. An environment variable `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` will be set using the Terraform Service Account to enable impersonation.

   ```bash
   export CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../0-bootstrap/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../0-bootstrap/" output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

**IMPORTANT:** The commands below assumes you are running it on the `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline` directory.

1. Run the command below to update the `perimeter_additional_members` in `common.auto.tfvars` for the non-production environment. The last line from your `perimeter_additional_members` should end following this format: `"serviceAccount:YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT"]` (with no comma in the and the `]` in the same line from the service account).

    ```bash

    cd ../../3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/non-production/

    UPDATE_SA=$(printf '"%s",\n"%s",\n"%s"]' "$TRIGGER_SA" "$GCP_SA_AIPLATFORM" "$API_ROBOT_SA")

    TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)

    awk -v new_entries="$UPDATE_SA" '
      /perimeter_additional_members = \[/ {
        print
        in_list=1
        next
      }
      in_list && /\]$/ {
        sub(/\]$/, "")
        print $0 ","
        printf "%s\n", new_entries
        in_list=0
        next
      }
      {print}
    ' common.auto.tfvars > "$TEMP_FILE"

    mv "$TEMP_FILE" common.auto.tfvars

    cat common.auto.tfvars ; echo ""
    ```

1. Apply the results for non-production environment on 3-networks-dual-svpc.

    ```bash
    cd ../..

    ./tf-wrapper.sh plan non-production
    ./tf-wrapper.sh apply non-production
    ```

1. Apply the results for production environment on 3-networks-dual-svpc.

    ```bash
    ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
    ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
    ```

1. Unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

   ```bash
   unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
   ```

### Permissions (steps for Cloud build and Local Terraform)

1. The default compute engine from non-production project must have `roles/aiplatform.admin` on the production project. Run the command below to assign the permission:

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id \
    --member="serviceAccount:$prj_n_machine_learning_project_number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --role='roles/aiplatform.admin'
    ```

1. The AI Platform Service Agent from production project must have `roles/storage.admin` on the non-production bucket. Run the command below to assign the permission

    ```bash
    export non_production_bucket_name=$(gcloud storage buckets list --project $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id --format="value(name)" |grep bkt)
    echo $non_production_bucket_name

    gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$non_production_bucket_name \
    --member="serviceAccount:service-$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role='roles/storage.admin'
    ```
**NOTE:** If the return of `$non_production_bucket_name` is empty, you may need to unset your billing quota project with the  command below:

```bash
	gcloud config unset billing/quota_project
```

1. The Default Compute Engine SA from production project must have `roles/storage.admin` on the non-production bucket. Run the command below to assign the permission

```bash
    gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$non_production_bucket_name\
    --member="serviceAccount:$prj_p_machine_learning_project_number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role='roles/storage.admin'
```

### Big Query with Cloud Build

**IMPORTANT**: The steps below are specific if you are deploying via `Cloud Build`. If you are deploying using Local Terraform, skip directly to the `Big Query with Local Terraform` section. The commands below assumes you are running it on the `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline` directory.

 1. In order to avoid having to specify a kms key for every query against a bigquery resource, we set the default project encryption key to the corresponding environment key in advance

    ```bash
    ml_project_dev=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    ml_project_dev_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)
    ml_project_nonprd=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    ml_project_nonprod_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)
    ml_project_prd=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    ml_project_prod_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)

    project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_dev_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
    echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_dev\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_dev" --nouse_legacy_sql

    project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_nonprod_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
    echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_nonprd\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_nonprd" --nouse_legacy_sql

    project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_prod_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
    echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_prd\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_prd" --nouse_legacy_sql
    ```

1. Many of the necessary service agents and permissions were deployed in all project environments for machine-learning.  Additional entries may be needed for each environment.

1. Add in more agents to the DEVELOPMENT.AUTO.TFVARS file under `egress_policies`. This file is in `gcp-networks` directory. Make sure you are in the `development` branch.

   - "serviceAccount:bq-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@bigquery-encryption.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

    This should be added under egress_policies -> notebooks -> identities.  It should look like this:

    ```text
    egress_policies = [
          // notebooks
          {
              "from" = {
              "identity_type" = ""
              "identities" = [
                  "serviceAccount:bq-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@bigquery-encryption.iam.gserviceaccount.com",   // << New Addition
                  "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
                  "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
              ]
              },
              "to" = {
              "resources" = ["projects/[prj-d-kms-project-number]"]
              "operations" = {
                  "compute.googleapis.com" = {
                  "methods" = ["*"]
                  }
                  "cloudkms.googleapis.com" = {
                  "methods" = ["*"]
                  }
              }
              }
          },
      ]
   ```

1. Once this addition has been done, it is necessary to trigger the cloudbuild for `gcp-networks` for development environment:

    ```bash
      cd gcp-networks
      git add .

      git commit -m 'Update egress rules'
      git push origin development
    ```

### Big Query with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build

  1. In order to avoid having to specify a kms key for every query against a bigquery resource, we set the default project encryption key to the corresponding environment key in advance. The commands below assumes you are running it on the `terraform-google-enterprise-genai/examples/machine-learning-pipeline` directory.

      ```bash
      ml_project_dev=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      ml_project_dev_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)
      ml_project_nonprd=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      ml_project_nonprod_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)
      ml_project_prd=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      ml_project_prod_key=$(terraform -chdir="../../4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -json machine_learning_kms_keys)

      project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_dev_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
      echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_dev\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_dev" --nouse_legacy_sql

      project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_nonprod_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
      echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_nonprd\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_nonprd" --nouse_legacy_sql

      project_key=$(echo "$ml_project_prod_key "| jq -r '."us-central1".id')
      echo "ALTER PROJECT \`$ml_project_prd\` SET OPTIONS (\`region-us-central1.default_kms_key_name\`=\"$project_key\");" | bq query --project_id "$ml_project_prd" --nouse_legacy_sql
      ```

1. Many of the necessary service agents and permissions were deployed in all project environments for machine-learning.  Additional entries may be needed for each environment.

1. Add in more agents to the DEVELOPMENT.AUTO.TFVARS file under `egress_policies`. This file is in `3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/development` directory.

   - "serviceAccount:bq-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@bigquery-encryption.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

    This should be added under egress_policies -> notebooks -> identities.  It should look like this:

    ```text
    egress_policies = [
          // notebooks
          {
              "from" = {
              "identity_type" = ""
              "identities" = [
                  "serviceAccount:bq-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@bigquery-encryption.iam.gserviceaccount.com",   // << New Addition
                  "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
                  "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-ml-machine-learning-project-number]@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
              ]
              },
              "to" = {
              "resources" = ["projects/[prj-d-kms-project-number]"]
              "operations" = {
                  "compute.googleapis.com" = {
                  "methods" = ["*"]
                  }
                  "cloudkms.googleapis.com" = {
                  "methods" = ["*"]
                  }
              }
              }
          },
      ]
   ```

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Seed project ID and the organization step Terraform service account from 0-bootstrap output. An environment variable `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` will be set using the Terraform Service Account to enable impersonation.

   ```bash
   export CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../0-bootstrap/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../0-bootstrap/" output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

1. Once this addition has been done, it is necessary apply the changes for `3-networks-dual-svpc` for development environment:

    ```bash
      cd ../../3-networks-dual-svpc

      ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
      ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
    ```

1. Unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

   ```bash
   unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
   ```

## Running the Machine Learning Pipeline

Each environment, Development, Non-Production and Production have their own purpose and they are not a mirror from the previous environment. As you can see on the diagram below:

+---------------+     +-----------------------------+  +----------------+
```

The Development environment is responsible to create pipeline components and make sure there are no issues in the environment, after running the notebook on the development environment you will have a Machine Learning Model deployed that can be viewed on the following link `<https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/online-prediction>` and a Vertex AI workbench instance that is billed, refer to the [following link](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#notebooks) for more detailed billing information.

The non-production environment will result in triggering the pipeline if approved. The vertex pipeline takes about 30 minutes to finish and deploys the model to production environment.

The production environment will provide an endpoint in the project which you can use to make prediction requests to the Machine Learning Model.

For our pipeline which trains and deploys a model on the [census income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income), we use a notebook in the development environment workbench to create our pipeline components, put them together into a pipeline and do a dry run of the pipeline to make sure there are no issues. You can access the repository that contains assets for the notebook [here](./assets/Vertexpipeline/).

There is a [Dockerfile](../../5-app-infra/source_repos/artifact-publish/images/vertexpipeline:v2/Dockerfile) in the repo which is the docker image used to run all pipeline steps and cloud build steps. In non-prod and prod environments, the only NIST compliant way to access additional dependencies and requirements is via docker images uploaded to artifact registry. We have baked everything for running the pipeline into this docker which exist in the shared artifact registry.

Once confident that the pipeline runs successfully on the development environment, we divide the code in two separate files to use in our CI/CD process, at the non-production environment. First file is *compile_pipeline.py* which includes the code to build the pipeline and compile it into a directory (in our case, `common/vertex-ai-pipeline/pipeline_package.yaml`)

The second file, i.e. *runpipeline.py* includes the code for running the compiled pipeline. This is where the correct environment variables for non-production and production (e.g., service accounts to use for each stage of the pipeline, kms keys corresponding to each step, buckets, etc.) are set. And eventually the pipeline is loaded from the yaml file at *common/vertex-ai-pipeline/pipeline_package.yaml* and submitted to Vertex AI.

There should be a *cloudbuild.yaml* template file at `examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/Vertexpipeline/cloudbuild.yaml` in this repository with the CI/CD steps as follows:

1. Upload the Dataflow src file to the bucket in non-prod
2. Upload the dataset to the bucket
3. Run *compile_pipeline.py* to compile the pipeline
4. Run the pipeline via *runpipeline.py*
5. Optionally, upload the pipeline's yaml file to the composer bucket to make it available for scheduled pipeline runs

The cloud build trigger will be setup in the non-production project which is where the previously validated ML pipeline will run. There should be three branches on the repo namely dev, non-prod, and prod. Cloud build will trigger the pipeline once there is a merge into the non-prod branch from dev. However, model deployment and monitorings steps take place in the production environment. As a result, the service agents and service accounts of the non-prod environment are given some permission on the prod environment and vice versa.

Each time a pipeline job finishes successfully, a new version of the census income bracket predictor model will be deployed on the endpoint which will only take 25 percent of the traffic wherease the other 75 percent goes to the previous version of the model to enable A/B testing.

You can read more about the details of the pipeline components on the [pipeline's repo](./assets/Vertexpipeline/)

### Step by step

If you are using Github make sure you have your personal git access token ready. The git menu option on the left bar of the workbench requires the personal token to connect to git and clone the repo.

Also make sure to have a gcs bucket ready to store the artifacts for the tutorial. To deploy a new bucket, you can go to service catalog and create a new deployment from the storage bucket solution.

#### Creating the Vertex AI Workbench Instance

- The workbench instance was deployed on `modules/base_env/main.tf` when running the infrastructure pipeline. You can also deploy notebook instances using Service Catalog, after configuring it, refer to [Google Docs for more information](https://cloud.google.com/service-catalog/docs/create-solutions).

#### 1. Run the notebook with Cloud Build

**IMPORTANT**: The steps below are specific if you are deploying via `Cloud Build`. If you are deploying using Local Terraform, skip directly to the `Run the notebook with Local Terraform` section.

1. Before running the notebook, create a new git repository with the content of `examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/Vertexpipeline` folder in the same level that your `terraform-google-enterprise-genai`. Take note of this git repository url, you will need it to clone the repository into your notebooks. You need to create `development` and `non-prod` branches in this repo.

1. Export the email address that will be used to monitor the configuration in the notebook. To do this, execute the following code:

    ```bash
      export your_monitoring_email="YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-COMPANY.COM"
      echo $your_monitoring_email
    ```

1. In the next step, you can use the following commands to update the placeholders used in the file `census_pipeline.ipynb`. The commands below assume that you are in the new Git repository you created, on the development branch.

    ```bash
      export prj_d_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      echo $prj_d_machine_learning_project_id

      export prj_d_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
      echo $prj_d_machine_learning_project_number

      export prj_d_shared_restricted_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-networks/envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
      echo $prj_d_shared_restricted_id

      export prj_d_kms_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-environments/envs/development" output -raw env_kms_project_id)
      echo $prj_d_kms_id

      export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
      echo $common_artifacts_project_id

      export development_bucket_name=$(gcloud storage buckets list --project $prj_d_machine_learning_project_id --format="value(name)" |grep bkt)
      echo $development_bucket_name


      sed -i \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID/$prj_d_machine_learning_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_BUCKET_ID/$development_bucket_name/g" \
        -e "s/YOUR_PROJECT_D_SHARED_ID/$prj_d_shared_restricted_id/g" \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_NUMBER/$prj_d_machine_learning_project_number/g" \
        -e "s/KMS_D_PROJECT_ID/$prj_d_kms_id/g" \
        -e "s/PRJ_C_ML_ARTIFACTS_ID/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-COMPANY.COM/$your_monitoring_email/g" \
        ./census_pipeline.ipynb
    ```

1. Push the changes to your Git Vertex repository (development branch):

    ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m 'Update census_pipeline.ipynb'
      git push --set-upstream origin development
    ```

1. Access workbench in your development project at the `https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances` link.

1. Click `Open Jupyterlab` button on the instance created, this will take you to an interactive environment inside Vertex AI.

1. Click the Git Icon (left side bar) and clone over HTTPS the repository you created, select the development branch.

1. Navigate to the directory that contains `census_pipeline.ipynb` file and execute [the notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-enterprise-genai/blob/main/examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/Vertexpipeline/census_pipeline.ipynb) cell by cell. Pay attention to the instructions and comments in the notebook, ensuring that you set the correct values for your development project. If a message pops up asking which kernel to use, select Python 3. Make sure you are in the `development branch` and the fields were populated properly.

***NOTE:*** If you get an error in the first run related to `bq-jobs` you may be facing some propagation issue. Re-run the last step from `census_pipeline.ipynb` should fix it.


#### 2. Configure cloud build trigger with Cloud Build

After the notebook runs successfully and the pipeline's test run finishes in the development environment, create a cloud build trigger in your non-production project. Configure the trigger to run when there is a merge into the non-prod branch by following the below settings.

1. You can use the command below to get the `NON-PROD_MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID`. The commands below assumes you are in the same level as `terraform-google-enterprise-genai` folder.
    ```bash
      export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id
      echo "trigger-sa@"$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id".iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

    |Setting|Value|
    |-------|-----|
    |Event|push to branch|
    |Repository generation|1st gen|
    |Repository|the url to your fork of the repo|
    |Branch|non-prod|
    |Configuration|Autodetected/Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)|
    |Location|Repository|
    |Cloud Build configuration file location|cloudbuild.yaml (only if you chose Cloud Build configuration file)|
    |Service Account|trigger-sa@YOUR_NON-PROD_MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com|

1. Execute the following commands to update the `cloudbuild.yaml` file. These commands assume that you are in the cloned Git repository and that you are on the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from `bucket-name` and `artifact-project`. You can find the template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/cloudbuild.yaml`.

    ```bash
    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export non_prod_bucket_name=$(gsutil ls -p $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id | grep -o 'gs://bkt-n-ml[^/]*')
    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="$directory" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    sed -i\
        -e "s/{NON_PROD_BUCKET_NAME}/$non_prod_bucket_name/g" \
        -e "s/{COMMOM_ARTIFACTS_PRJ_ID}/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
    ./cloudbuild.yaml
    ```

1. Optionally, if you want to schedule pipeline runs on regular intervals, uncomment the last two steps and replace the composer bucket with the name of your composer's bucket. The first step uploads the pipeline's yaml to the bucket and the second step uploads the dag to read that yaml and trigger the vertex pipeline:

    ```yaml
    # upload to composer
      - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
        args: ['cp', './common/vertex-ai-pipeline/pipeline_package.yaml', 'gs://{your-composer-bucket}/dags/common/vertex-ai-pipeline/']
        id: 'upload_composer_file'

    # upload pipeline dag to composer
        - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
          args: ['cp', './composer/dags/dag.py', 'gs://{your-composer-bucket}/dags/']
          id: 'upload dag'
    ```

1. Execute the following commands to update the `runpipeline.py` file. These commands assume that you are in the same Git repository from previous step and in the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from the projects that were deployed. You can find the example template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/runpipeline.py`.

    ```bash
    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="$directory" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    export directory="../gcp-environments/envs/non-production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout non-production)

    export prj_n_kms_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-environments/envs/non-production" output -raw env_kms_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_kms_id

    export directory="../gcp-networks/envs/non-production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout non-production)

    export prj_n_shared_restricted_id=$(terraform -chdir="$directory" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_shared_restricted_id

    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout non-production)

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_number

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export non_prod_bucket_name=$(gsutil ls -p $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id | grep -o 'gs://bkt-n-ml[^/]*')
    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

    export dataflow_sa="dataflow-sa@${prj_n_machine_learning_project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    echo $dataflow_sa

    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_number

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id

    export directory="../gcp-environments/envs/production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export prj_p_kms_id=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-environments/envs/production" output -raw env_kms_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_kms_id

    sed -i \
        -e "s/{PRJ_C_MLARTIFACTS_ID}/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/{PRJ_N_KMS_ID}/$prj_n_kms_id/g" \
        -e "s/{PRJ_N_SHARED_RESTRICTED_ID}/$prj_n_shared_restricted_id/g" \

    ```

1. Execute the following commands to update the `compile_pipeline.py` file. These commands assume that you are in the same Git repository from previous step and in the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from the projects that were deployed. You can find the example template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/compile_pipeline.py`.

    ```bash
    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/shared"
    (cd $directory && git checkout production)

    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="$directory" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    export directory="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production"
    (cd $directory && git checkout non-production)

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir=$directory output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export non_prod_bucket_name=$(gsutil ls -p $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id | grep -o 'gs://bkt-n-ml[^/]*')
    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

    sed -i \
        -e "s/{NON_PROD_BUCKET_NAME}/$non_prod_bucket_name/g" \
        -e "s/{COMMOM_ARTIFACTS_PRJ_ID}/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/{PRJ_N_MACHINE_LEARNING_ID}/$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id/g" \
    ./compile_pipeline.py

    ```

***NOTE:*** If you get an error in the first run related to `bq-jobs` you may be facing some propagation issue. Re-try the triger previous created should fix it.

#### 1. Run the notebook with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build


1. Before running the notebook, create a Git repository with the content of `examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/Vertexpipeline` folder in the same level that your `terraform-google-enterprise-genai`. Take note of this git repository url, you will need it to clone the repository into your notebooks. You need to create `development` and `non-prod` branches in this repo.

1. Export the email address that will be used to monitor the configuration in the notebook. To do this, execute the following code:

    ```bash
      export your_monitoring_email="YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-COMPANY.COM"
      echo $your_monitoring_email
    ```

1. In the next step, you can use the following commands to update the placeholders used in the file `census_pipeline.ipynb`. The commands below assume that you are in the new Git repository you created, on the development branch.

    ```bash
	export prj_d_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
	echo $prj_d_machine_learning_project_id

	export prj_d_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/development" output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
	echo $prj_d_machine_learning_project_number

	export prj_d_shared_restricted_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/development" output -raw restricted_host_project_id)
	echo $prj_d_shared_restricted_id

	export prj_d_kms_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/2-environments/envs/development" output -raw env_kms_project_id)
	echo $prj_d_kms_id

	export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
	echo $common_artifacts_project_id

	export development_bucket_name=$(gcloud storage buckets list --project $prj_d_machine_learning_project_id --format="value(name)" |grep bkt)
	echo $development_bucket_name

      sed -i \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID/$prj_d_machine_learning_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_BUCKET_ID/$development_bucket_name/g" \
        -e "s/YOUR_PROJECT_D_SHARED_ID/$prj_d_shared_restricted_id/g" \
        -e "s/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_NUMBER/$prj_d_machine_learning_project_number/g" \
        -e "s/KMS_D_PROJECT_ID/$prj_d_kms_id/g" \
        -e "s/PRJ_C_ML_ARTIFACTS_ID/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-COMPANY.COM/$your_monitoring_email/g" \
        ./census_pipeline.ipynb
    ```

1. Push the changes to your Git Vertex repository (development branch):

    ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m 'Update census_pipeline.ipynb'
      git push --set-upstream origin development
    ```

1. Access workbench in your development project at the `https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances` link.

1. Click `Open Jupyterlab` button on the instance created, this will take you to an interactive environment inside Vertex AI.

1. Click the Git Icon (left side bar) and clone over HTTPS the repository you created, select the development branch.

1. Navigate to the directory that contains `census_pipeline.ipynb` file and execute [the notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-enterprise-genai/blob/main/examples/machine-learning-pipeline/assets/Vertexpipeline/census_pipeline.ipynb) cell by cell. Pay attention to the instructions and comments in the notebook, ensuring that you set the correct values for your development project. If a message pops up asking which kernel to use, select Python 3. Make sure you are in the `development branch` and the fields were populated properly.

***NOTE:*** If you get an error in the first run related to `bq-jobs` you may be facing some propagation issue. Re-run the last step from `census_pipeline.ipynb` should fix it.


#### 2. Configure cloud build trigger with Local Terraform - Only proceed with these if you have not used Cloud Build

After the notebook runs successfully and the pipeline's test run finishes in the development environment, create a cloud build trigger in your non-production project. Configure the trigger to run when there is a merge into the non-prod branch by following the below settings.

1. You can use the command below to get the `NON-PROD_MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID`.
    ```bash
      export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id
      echo "trigger-sa@"$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id".iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

    |Setting|Value|
    |-------|-----|
    |Event|push to branch|
    |Repository generation|1st gen|
    |Repository|the url to your fork of the repo|
    |Branch|non-prod|
    |Configuration|Autodetected/Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)|
    |Location|Repository|
    |Cloud Build configuration file location|cloudbuild.yaml (only if you chose Cloud Build configuration file)|
    |Service Account|trigger-sa@YOUR_NON-PROD_MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com|

1. Execute the following commands to update the `cloudbuild.yaml` file. These commands assume that you are in the cloned Git repository and that you are on the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from `bucket-name` and `artifact-project`. You can find the template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/cloudbuild.yaml`.

    ```bash
    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export non_prod_bucket_name=$(gsutil ls -p $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id | grep -o 'gs://bkt-n-ml[^/]*')
    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    sed -i\
        -e "s/{NON_PROD_BUCKET_NAME}/$non_prod_bucket_name/g" \
        -e "s/{COMMOM_ARTIFACTS_PRJ_ID}/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
    ./cloudbuild.yaml
    ```

1. Optionally, if you want to schedule pipeline runs on regular intervals, uncomment the last two steps and replace the composer bucket with the name of your composer's bucket. The first step uploads the pipeline's yaml to the bucket and the second step uploads the dag to read that yaml and trigger the vertex pipeline:

    ```yaml
    # upload to composer
      - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
        args: ['cp', './common/vertex-ai-pipeline/pipeline_package.yaml', 'gs://{your-composer-bucket}/dags/common/vertex-ai-pipeline/']
        id: 'upload_composer_file'

    # upload pipeline dag to composer
        - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
          args: ['cp', './composer/dags/dag.py', 'gs://{your-composer-bucket}/dags/']
          id: 'upload dag'
    ```

1. Execute the following commands to update the `runpipeline.py` file. These commands assume that you are in the same Git repository from previous step and in the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from the projects that were deployed. You can find the example template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/runpipeline.py`.

    ```bash
    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir=../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

    export dataflow_sa="dataflow-sa@${prj_n_machine_learning_project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    echo $dataflow_sa

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_number=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_number)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_number

    export prj_p_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id

    export prj_p_kms_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/2-environments/envs/production" output -raw env_kms_project_id)
    echo $prj_p_kms_id

    sed -i \
        -e "s/{PRJ_C_MLARTIFACTS_ID}/$common_artifacts_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/{PRJ_N_KMS_ID}/$prj_n_kms_id/g" \

        -e "s/{PRJ_P_MACHINE_LEARNING_ID}/$prj_p_machine_learning_project_id/g" \
        -e "s/{PRJ_P_KMS_ID}/$prj_p_kms_id/g" \
        -e "s/YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-COMPANY.COM/$your_monitoring_email/g" \
    ./runpipeline.py
    ```

1. Execute the following commands to update the `compile_pipeline.py` file. These commands assume that you are in the same Git repository from previous step and in the development branch. The output will include placeholders that need to be replaced with values from the projects that were deployed. You can find the example template at `assets/Vertexpipeline/compile_pipeline.py`.

    ```bash
    export common_artifacts_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/shared" output -raw common_artifacts_project_id)
    echo $common_artifacts_project_id

    export prj_n_machine_learning_project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-google-enterprise-genai/4-projects/ml_business_unit/non-production" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
    echo $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id

    export non_prod_bucket_name=$(gsutil ls -p $prj_n_machine_learning_project_id | grep -o 'gs://bkt-n-ml[^/]*')
    non_prod_bucket_name=$(echo $non_prod_bucket_name | sed 's#gs://##')
    echo $non_prod_bucket_name

        -e "s/{PRJ_N_MACHINE_LEARNING_ID}/$prj_n_machine_learning_project_id/g" \
    ./compile_pipeline.py
    ```

#### 3. Configure variables in compile_pipeline.py and runpipeline.py

- Make sure to set the correct values for variables like **PROJECT_ID**, **BUCKET_URI**, encryption keys and service accounts, etc.:

    |variable|definition|example value|How to obtain|
    |--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
    |PROJECT_ID|The id of the non-prod project|`{non-prod-project-id}`|From the project's menu in console navigate to the `fldr-non-production/fldr-non-production-ml` folder; here you can find the machine learning project in non-prod (`prj-n-ml-machine-learning`) and obtain its' ID|
    |BUCKET_URI|URI of the non-prod bucket|`gs://non-prod-bucket`|From the project menu in console navigate to the non-prod ML project `fldr-non-production/fldr-non-production-ml/prj-n-ml-machine-learning` project, navigate to cloud storage and copy the name of the bucket available there|
    |REGION|The region for pipeline jobs|Can be left as default `us-central1`|
    |PROD_PROJECT_ID|ID of the prod project|`prod-project-id`|In console's project menu, navigate to the `fldr-production/fldr-production-ml` folder; here you can find the machine learning project in prod (`prj-p-ml-machine-learning`) and obtain its' ID|
    |Image|The image artifact used to run the pipeline components. The image is already built and pushed to the artifact repository in your artifact project under the common folder|`f"us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/{artifact-project}/{artifact-repository}/vertexpipeline:v2"`|Navigate to `fldr-common/prj-c-ml-artifacts` project. Navigate to the artifact registry repositories in the project to find the full name of the image artifact.|
    |DATAFLOW_SUBNET|The shared subnet in non-prod env required to run the dataflow job|`https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{non-prod-network-project}/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/{subnetwork-name}`|Navigate to the `fldr-network/prj-n-shared-restricted` project. Navigate to the VPC networks and under the subnets tab, find the name of the network associated with your region (us-central1)|
    |SERVICE_ACCOUNT|The service account used to run the pipeline and it's components such as the model monitoring job. This is the compute default service account of non-prod if you don't plan on using another costume service account|`{non-prod-project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`|Head over to the IAM page in the non-prod project `fldr-non-production/fldr-non-production-ml/prj-n-mlmachine-learning`, check the box for `Include Google-provided role grants` and look for the service account with the `{project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`|
    |PROD_SERICE_ACCOUNT|The service account used to create endpoint, upload the model, and deploy the model in the prod project. This is the compute default service account of prod if you don't plan on using another costume service account|`{prod-project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`|Head over to the IAM page in the prod project `fldr-production/fldr-production-ml/prj-p-ml-machine-learning`, check the box for `Include Google-provided role grants` and look for the service account with the `{project_number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`|
    |deployment_config['encryption']|The kms key for the prod env. This key is used to encrypt the vertex model, endpoint, model deployment, and model monitoring.|`projects/{prod-kms-project}/locations/us-central1/keyRings/{keyring-name}/cryptoKeys/{key-name}`|Navigate to `fldr-production/prj-n-kms`, navigate to the Security/Key management in that project to find the key in `sample-keyring` keyring of your target region `us-central1`|
    |encryption_spec_key_name|The name of the encryption key for the non-prod env. This key is used to create the vertex pipeline job and it's associated metadata store|`projects/{non-prod-kms-project}/locations/us-central1/keyRings/{keyring-name}/cryptoKeys/{key-name}`|Navigate to `fldr-non-production/prj-n-kms`, navigate to the Security/Key management in that project to find the key in `sample-keyring` keyring of your target region `us-central1`|
    |monitoring_config['email']|The email that Vertex AI monitoring will email alerts to|`your email`|your email associated with your gcp account|

The compile_pipeline.py and runpipeline.py files are commented to point out these variables.

#### 4. Merge and deploy

Once everything is configured, you can commit your changes and push to the development branch. Then, create a PR to from dev to non-prod which will result in triggering the pipeline if approved. The vertex pipeline takes about 30 minutes to finish and if there are no errors, a trained model will be deployed to and endpoint in the prod project which you can use to make prediction requests.

1. The command below assumes that you are in the Git repository you cloned in the `Configure cloud build trigger` step and you are in the `development` branch.
    ```bash
      git add .

      git commit -m 'Update notebook files'
      git push origin development
    ```

    ***NOTE:*** If you get an error in the first run related to `bq-jobs` you may be facing some propagation issue. Re-try the triger previous created should fix it.

#### 5. Model Validation

Once you have the model running at an endpoint in the production project, you will be able to test it. It is expected you are in the Git repository you created in previous steps to run the commands below.
Here are the instructions to make a request to your model using `gcloud` and `curl`:

1. Initialize variables on your terminal session

    ```bash
    export ENDPOINT_ID=$(gcloud ai endpoints list --region=us-central1 --project=$prj_p_machine_learning_project_id |awk 'NR==2 {print $1}')
    echo $ENDPOINT_ID

    echo $prj_p_machine_learning_project_id
    export INPUT_DATA_FILE="body.json"

    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${prj_p_machine_learning_project_id}/locations/us-central1/endpoints/${ENDPOINT_ID}:predict -d "@${INPUT_DATA_FILE}"
    ```

    - You should get an output from 0 to 1, indicating the level of confidence of the binary classification based on the parameters above.
    Values closer to 1 means the individual is more likely to be included in the income_bracket greater than 50K.

## Optional: Composer

**Note 1:** If you are using MacOS, replace `cp -RT` with `cp -R` in the relevant commands. The `-T` flag is needed for Linux, but causes problems for MacOS.

**Note 2:** If you are deploying using Local Terraform, you need to chant the output line to `3-networks-dual-svpc` instead of `gcp-projects`.

If you have chosen to deploy Composer with the Pipeline, you will need a github repository set up for this step. This repository houses the DAG's for composer. As of this writing, the structure is as follows:

   ```
   .
   ├── README.md
   └── dags
      ├── hello_world.py
      └── strings.py
   ```

Add in your dags in the `dags` folder.  Any changes to this folder will trigger a pipeline and place the dags in the appropriate composer environment depending on which branch it is pushed to (`development`, `non-production`, `production`)

1. Composer will rely on DAG's from a github repository.  In `4-projects`, a secret 'github-api-token' was created to house your github's api access key.  We need to create a new version for this secret which will be used in the composer module which is called in the `base_env` folder.  Use the script below to add the secrets into each machine learnings respective environment:

   ```bash
   envs=(development non-production production)
   project_ids=()
   github_token="YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN"

   for env in "${envs[@]}"; do
      output=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-projects/ml_business_unit/${env}" output -raw machine_learning_project_id)
      project_ids+=("$output")
   done

   for project in "${project_ids[@]}"; do
      echo -n $github_token | gcloud secrets versions add github-api-token --data-file=- --project=${project}
   done
   ```

## Common errors

- ***google.api_core.exceptions.ResourceExhausted: 429 The following quotas are exceeded: ```CustomModelServingCPUsPerProjectPerRegion 8: The following quotas are exceeded: CustomModelServingCPUsPerProjectPerRegion``` or similar error***:
This is likely due to the fact that you have too many models uploaded and deployed in Vertex AI. To resolve the issue, you can either submit a quota increase request or undeploy and delete a few models to free up resources.

- ***Google Compute Engine Metadata service not available/found***:
You might encounter this when the vertex pipeline job attempts to run even though it is an obsolete issue according to [this thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/229537245#comment9). It'll most likely resolve by re-running the vertex pipeline.

### Troubleshooting

#### Service Agent not existent

##### Storage

- Error: Error updating AccessLevel "accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL": googleapi: Error 400: The email address '<service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com>' is invalid or non-existent.
  - To fix run: `gcloud storage service-agent --project=project_id_here`

- If you get the error below when trying to list a bucket, it may be related to a quota project being used. To resolve this error, you may need to unset the quota_project from your gcloud config.

  ```bash
  ERROR: (gcloud.storage.buckets.list) HTTPError 403: Request is prohibited by organization's policy. vpcServiceControlsUniqueIdentifier: XxxxIqGYRNlbbDfpK4PxxxxS5mX3uln6o2sKd_B6RRYiFR_wfSyXxx. This command is authenticated as your_user@your-company.com which is the active account specified by the [core/account] property
  ```

  ```bash
  gcloud config list
  gcloud config unset billing/quota_project
  ```


##### Vertex AI Platform

-  Error: Request `Create IAM Members roles/bigquery.dataViewer serviceAccount:service-<project_number>gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com for project "project_id"` returned error: Batch request and retried single request "Create IAM Members roles/bigquery.dataViewer serviceAccount:service-<project_number>gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com for project \"project_id\"" both failed. Final error: Error applying IAM policy for project "project_id": Error setting IAM policy for project "project_id": googleapi: Error 400: Invalid service account (service-<project_number>gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com)., badRequest

  - To fix run: `gcloud beta services identity create --service=aiplatform.googleapis.com --project=<project_number>`

#### VPC-SC

In case you face some error related to permission denied, you may need to add the following service accounts in the `common.auto.tfvars` file.

```bash
"run_job": google.api_core.exceptions.PermissionDenied:
```

- Under `COMMON.AUTO.TFVARS`, add these entries under for `DEVELOPMENT` environment:

    ```bash
    "serviceAccount:[prj-d-mlmachine-learning-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:service-[prj-p-mlmachine-learning-number]@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    ```

- Under `COMMON.AUTO.TFVARS`, add these entries under for `NON-PRODUCTION` environment:

    ```bash
    "serviceAccount:[prj-d-mlmachine-learning-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:service-[prj-p-mlmachine-learning-number]@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    ```

- Under `COMMON.AUTO.TFVARS`, add these entries under for `PRODUCTION` environment:

    ```bash
    "serviceAccount:[prj-d-mlmachine-learning-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com",
    "serviceAccount:cloud-aiplatform-api-robot-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com",
    ```

#### Service Catalog

- If you have set up service catalog and attempt to deploy out terraform code, there is a high chance you will encounter this error:
`Permission denied; please check you have the correct IAM permissions and APIs enabled.`
This is  due to a VPC Service control error that until now, is impossible to add into the egress policy.  Go to `prj-d-ml-machine-learning` project and view the logs, filtering for ERRORS.  There will be a VPC Service Controls entry that has an `egressViolation`.  It should look something like the following:

  ```
  egressViolations: [
    0: {

- We want the `unknown-project-number` here.  Add this into your `egress_policies` in `3-networks` under DEVELOPMENT.AUTO.TFVARS, NON-PRODUCTION.AUTO.TFVARS & PRODUCTION.AUTO.TFVARS

  ```
  // Service Catalog
    {
      "from" = {
        "identity_type" = "ANY_IDENTITY"
        "identities"    = []
      },
      "to" = {
        "resources" = ["projects/[unknown-project-number]"]
        "operations" = {
          "cloudbuild.googleapis.com" = {
            "methods" = ["*"]
          }
        }
      }
    },
  ```
