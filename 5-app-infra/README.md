# 5-app-infra

This repo is part of a multi-part guide that shows how to configure and deploy
the example.com reference architecture described in
[Google Cloud security foundations guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations). The following table lists the parts of the guide.

## Purpose

Folders `1-artifact-publish`, `3-serive-catalog` and `5-machine-learning` are projects that will be _expanded_ upon.  In step 4, we have initiated the creation of these projects, enabled API's and assigned roles to various service accounts, service agents and cryptography keys that are needed for each respective project to operate successfully.  Folders `2-artifact-publish-repo` and `4-service-catalog-repo` are seperate cloud build repositories that have their own unique piplelines configured. These are used for building out in-house Docker images for your machine-learning pipelines and terraform modules that will be used in `notebooks` in your interactive (development) environment, as well as deployment modules for your operational (non-production, production) environments respectively.

For the purposes of this demonstration, we assume that you are using Cloud Build or manual deployment.

When viewing each folder under `projects`, consider them as seperate repositories which will be used to deploy out each respective project.  In the case of using Cloud Build (which is what this example is primarily based on), each folder will be placed in its own GCP cloud source repository for deployment.  There is a README placed in each project folder which will highlight the necessary steps to achieve deployment.

When deploying/expanding upon each project, you will find your Cloud Build pipelines being executed in `prj-c-bu3infra-pipeline`.

The order of deployments for the machine-learning's project is as follows:

* 0-gcp-polcies
* 1-artifact-publish
* 2-artifact-publish-repo
* 3-service-catalog
* 4-service-catalog-repo
* 5-vpc-sc
* 6-machine-learning
* 7-machine-learning-post-deploy

## VPC-SC

Be aware that for the purposes of this machine learning project, there are several projects in each respective environment that have been placed within a `service perimeter`.
As such, during your deployment process, you _will_ encounter deployment errors related to VPC-SC violations.  Before continuing onto `5-app-infra/projects`, you will need to go _back_ into `3-networks-dual-svpc` and _update_
your ingress rules.

Below, you can find the values that will need to be applied to `common.auto.tfvars` and your `development.auto.tfvars`, ###`non-production.auto.tfvars` & `production.auto.tfvars`.

In `common.auto.tfvars` update your `perimeter_additional_members` to include:
 * the service acccount for bu3infra-pipeline: `"serviceAccount:sa-tf-cb-bu3-machine-learning@[prj-c-bu3infra-pipeline-project-id].iam.gserviceaccount.com"`
 * the service account for your cicd pipeline: `"serviceAccount:sa-terraform-env@[prj-b-seed-project-id].iam.gserviceaccount.com"`
 * your development environment logging bucket service account: `"serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-logging-project-number]@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"`
 * your development environment service acount for cloudbuild: `"serviceAccount:[prj-d-machine-learning-project-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com"`

 In each respective environment folders, update your `development.auto.tfvars`, `non-production.auto.tfvars` & `production.auto.tfvars` to include these changes:

    ```
    ingress_policies = [
        // users
        {
            "from" = {
            "identity_type" = "ANY_IDENTITY"
            "sources" = {
                "access_level" = "accessPolicies/270868347751/accessLevels/alp_d_shared_restricted_members_556e"
            }
            },
            "to" = {
            "resources" = [
                "projects/[prj-[your-environment-shared-restricted-project-number]",
                "projects/[prj-[your-environment-kms-project-number]",
                "projects/[prj-[your-environment-bu3machine-learning-number]",
            ]
            "operations" = {
                "compute.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
                "dns.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
                "logging.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
                "storage.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
                "cloudkms.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
            }
            }
        },
    ]
    ```

for your DEVELOPMENT.AUTO.TFVARS file, also include this as an egress policy:

    ```
    egress_policies = [
        // notebooks
        {
            "from" = {
            "identity_type" = ""
            "identities" = [
                "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-bu3machine-learning-project-number]@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
                "serviceAccount:service-[prj-d-bu3machine-learning-project-number]@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
            ]
            },
            "to" = {
            "resources" = ["projects/[prj-d-kms-project-number]"]
            "operations" = {
                "compute.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
                "cloudkms.googleapis.com" = {
                "methods" = ["*"]
                }
            }
            }
        },
    ]
    ```

Please note that this will cover some but not ALL the policies that will be needed.  During deployment there will be violations that will occur which come from unknown google projects outside the scope of your organization.  It will be the responsibility of the operator(s) deploying this process to view logs about the errors and make adjustments accordingly.  Most notably, this was observed for Service Catalog.  There will be an instance where an egress policy to be added for `cloudbuild.googleapis.com` access:

    ```
    // Service Catalog
    {
        "from" = {
        "identity_type" = "ANY_IDENTITY"
        "identities"    = []
        },
        "to" = {
        "resources" = ["projects/[some random google project id]"]
        "operations" = {
            "cloudbuild.googleapis.com" = {
            "methods" = ["*"]
            }
        }
        }
    },
    ```
